# Load Balancer in Golang

This project is a simple load balancer developed as part of a study in Golang. It is important to note that this load balancer is not meant to be functional or used in production in any way. It was created solely for educational purposes and to explore the basic concepts of load balancing.

## Functionality

The load balancer implements a "Round-Robin" mechanism, transferring the request to the next available server in the list. This means that if a server is unavailable, the request will be forwarded to the next active server. However, it is important to note that this is not the most efficient mechanism for load balancing in real-world environments.

## Configuration

In this example project, simple links have been provided as placeholders, but in a more complete project, you should replace them with the corresponding server addresses.

## Disclaimer

This project was developed as part of my study in Golang and is only my second project in the language. Therefore, there may be limitations and best practices that have not been addressed.

## Reference

This project was developed based on the material posted by Akhil Sharma on YouTube. You can find the original video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSDYx9eOiqo).
